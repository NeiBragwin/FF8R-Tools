# FF8R-Tools
A tool to unpack the archive files (.zzz) from FINAL FANTASY VIII Remastered.

Only official .zzz files can be used. In later versions, I'll try to parse customized .zzz file and add a pack functionality

```
Usage: FF8R-Tools [options] file
Options:
   -x    unpack the file
   -l    list the files into a textfile
   -o <path>     output to path
```
